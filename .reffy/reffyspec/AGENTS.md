# ReffySpec Instructions

These instructions are for AI assistants working in this project.

## TL;DR Checklist

- Read the relevant current specs in `.reffy/reffyspec/specs/` before changing behavior.
- Review active changes in `.reffy/reffyspec/changes/` before drafting or implementing new work.
- Use ReffySpec change proposals for new capabilities, breaking changes, or architecture shifts.
- Keep current truth in `.reffy/reffyspec/specs/` and proposed deltas in `.reffy/reffyspec/changes/`.

## ReffySpec Workflow

1. Read `.reffy/reffyspec/project.md` for project conventions.
2. Inspect current specs in `.reffy/reffyspec/specs/`.
3. Inspect active changes in `.reffy/reffyspec/changes/`.
4. Draft or update proposal/design/tasks/spec files under `.reffy/reffyspec/changes/<change-id>/`.
5. Use native Reffy commands for routine planning workflow:
   - `reffy plan create`
   - `reffy plan validate`
   - `reffy plan list`
   - `reffy plan show`
   - `reffy plan archive`
   - `reffy spec list`
   - `reffy spec show`

## Directory Model

- `.reffy/reffyspec/changes/` contains active proposed changes.
- `.reffy/reffyspec/changes/archive/` contains historical archived changes.
- `.reffy/reffyspec/specs/` contains current truth for each capability.
- The active-change tree is exhaustive: `proposal.md`, `tasks.md`, optional `design.md`, and one `specs/<capability>/spec.md` per affected capability.
- Arbitrary additional change-local paths are unsupported. Put durable decisions in `design.md`, checklist work in `tasks.md`, and exploratory context in indexed `.reffy/artifacts/`.

## Proposal Rules

- Use a unique verb-led `change-id` in kebab-case.
- Include `proposal.md`, `tasks.md`, optional `design.md`, and delta specs per affected capability.
- Delta specs must use `## ADDED|MODIFIED|REMOVED|RENAMED Requirements`.
- Each requirement must include at least one `#### Scenario:`.
- Rename-only entries use paired `FROM: ### Requirement: Old Name` and `TO: ### Requirement: New Name` lines and do not need scenarios; a following `MODIFIED` block uses the new name.

## Representing Pivots

- A pivot, deprecation, or wind-down is not a special object — it is an ordinary change whose delta is mostly `REMOVED`/`MODIFIED` requirements.
- Never edit or delete an archived change to reverse direction; land a new change on top. The archive is an append-only ledger and canonical `specs/` always reflects current truth.
- When a change reverses or replaces the direction of a prior one, name the prior change-id(s) in a `## Supersedes` section of `proposal.md`. This is a navigational pointer; the spec delta remains the authoritative record of what changed.

## Reffy Relationship

- Reffy owns the runtime and artifact workflow.
- ReffySpec is the canonical planning/spec surface.
- Reffy artifacts in `.reffy/` should inform proposal/design content without duplicating the full planning files.
