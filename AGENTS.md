# Reffy Instructions

These instructions are for AI assistants working in this project.

Always open `@/.reffy/AGENTS.md` when the request:
- Mentions early-stage ideation, exploration, brainstorming, or raw notes
- Needs context before drafting specs or proposals
- Refers to "reffy", "references", "explore", or "context layer"
- Involves a remote workspace, remote synchronization, shared-reference publication, or Paseo

Use `@/.reffy/AGENTS.md` to learn:
- Reffy workflow for ideation, artifact indexing, and planning scaffolds
- How Reffy owns the runtime while preserving ReffySpec planning files
- How to store and consume ideation context in `.reffy/`

Before performing any Reffy workflow:

1. Inspect `.reffy/skills/` (or run `reffy skill list`) to enumerate available skills.
2. Match the request against each skill's `description` and `triggers`.
3. Read the selected `SKILL.md` completely.
4. Follow that skill before running Reffy commands.

For remote workspace, remote sync, shared-reference publication, or Paseo requests, read `@/.reffy/skills/sync-remote/SKILL.md` first. Loading these instructions does not authorize a remote push or other mutation; execute remote commands only when the request calls for them.

Keep this managed block so `reffy init` can refresh the instructions.

# ReffySpec Instructions

These instructions are for AI assistants working in this project.

Always open `@/.reffy/reffyspec/AGENTS.md` when the request:
- Mentions planning or proposals (words like proposal, spec, change, plan)
- Introduces new capabilities, breaking changes, architecture shifts, or big performance/security work
- Needs the authoritative planning/spec workflow for this repo

Use `@/.reffy/reffyspec/AGENTS.md` to learn:
- How to create and apply ReffySpec change proposals
- ReffySpec format and conventions
- Project structure and planning guidelines

Keep this managed block so `reffy init` can refresh the instructions.

## Workstation onboarding

When a user asks to prepare this repository for local development, follow `init.md`. Run the guide's read-only workstation check first. Keep Databricks profile/account selection explicit, obtain approval before repairs or login flows, preserve an existing `.env`, and do not create, start, or deploy cloud resources without an explicit request.
